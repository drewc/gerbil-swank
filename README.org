#+title: A Swanky Gerbil

In 2004 I become a lispnick, using Common Lisp. That was just around the time
that SLIME came out, which is a way to interact with lisp from emacs.

Now, I use gerbil. Yet, SLIME still works, and has a whole bunch of things
associated with it that are very much needed for my gerbil interaction.

Not only that, but there are a bunch of things in gerbil that I have no idea
about, whereas long time CL'ing means I know where to find things on that side.

So, this should also help as a bridge between CL and Gerbil.
